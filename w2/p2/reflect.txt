1. 	Copy and move are different concept. copy Operator need to allocate memory and 
	do the deep copy. 
	Move operator only need to move the value and delete and obj after moving step.
	So the move operator processing time will be faster than copy operator.

2.	In function "AirportLog::AirportLog(string fileName)". we need to re-read the file
	after count the file length. but at this moment, I have no idea how to do, if no need 
	re read the file.

3.	A steady_clock is always provide a steady time and only move forward and will not change
    even a system_clock had changed. and steady_clock will not Guarantee the time is same with
	the real time. And the steady_clock provide a consistent time, even in different
	system. So it always uses for count the program processing speed.

	system_clock is relate to the real-time. if we system move to different time zone.
	system_clock will change to the current time zone and time. which mean the clock can 
	be backward to the past
